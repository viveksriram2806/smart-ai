## 1️⃣ Project Overview

**Project Name:**  
AI-in-the-Room – Smart Study Companion

**Purpose of the Application:**  
AI-in-the-Room is a smart AI assistant that joins online study group meetings as a virtual participant. It listens to discussions and helps students by giving instant, context-based answers without stopping the conversation.

**Problem It Solves:**  
During online study sessions, students often stop discussions to search the internet for answers or to check information. This breaks the flow of conversation, wastes time, and makes learning tiring. The application helps avoid these problems by providing support during live discussions.

## Problem Statement – Description

Online study groups are widely used for collaborative learning, but frequent interruptions occur when students pause discussions to search the internet for explanations or verification. This constant switching between discussion and browsing breaks concentration, causes loss of focus, and leads to missed important points. Opening multiple tabs makes discussions unorganized and mentally exhausting, increasing the time required to complete study sessions. Additionally, key insights from meetings are often not properly recorded, leading to poor retention after the session ends. Existing meeting platforms do not provide real-time, context-aware assistance, forcing students to manually search and take notes. As a result, collaborative learning becomes slow and stressful, highlighting the need for a smart system that can assist during live discussions, provide instant relevant information, and automatically generate summaries and study materials.
